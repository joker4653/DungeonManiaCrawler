Usability
No major issues with game usability
Some customisations made to the game to the game experience (e.g music & skins)

Modelling of Entities
UML all looks good & correctly formatted

Coupling & Cohesion
Most classes are kept relatively concise
Generally, a nice delegation of logic between classes

Design Patterns
All patterns seem to make sense and be well used 
Some patterns are not fully implemented within the code'

Evolution of Design 
Nice job refactoring many of the elements of the design from M2
M3 functionalities were not fully completed but those that were are integrated well into the existing code

Testing 
Testing pdf has been updated for M3 functionalities
Tests are all well-commented and readable

Code Quality
Code all looks nice and consistent & variables + functions seem meaningfully named.
Try and get rid of all your unused imports/variables to avoid cluttering files
Some functions e.g. legalMove in player have quite a lot of complexity to them & could be further modularised

Ticket Lifecycle & Planning
Planning & ticket lifecycle all looks good
